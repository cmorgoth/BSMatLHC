The BSMGen package implements a set of workflows to run study hep processes in PYTHIA8.
Currently, the following workflows are implemented:

- SUSYDecay: takes as input the mass spectrum of a SUSY model, written in SLHA format, 
             and computes the inclusive cross section, as well as the crooss section of 
             individual processes

- GenPythia: takes as input a pythia card and generates a sample of events that are then 
             processes through Delphes to apply ATLAS and CMS detector effects

- LHEGen: takes as input a sample of generated events (in LHE format), apply parton
          shower/hadronization through Pythia and process the events through Delphes
      	  to apply ATLAS and CMS detector effects

- STDHEPConverter: convert an STDHEP file in the .root format produced
                   normally by BSMGen

IMPORTANT:
-----------

To run BSMGen you need to correctly set the environment for pythia to sun, 
sourcing the configuration script 

source setup.(c)sh

use the one corresponding to the shell you are using.
